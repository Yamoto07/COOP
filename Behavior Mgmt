INTRODUCTION 

Mental illness is a term used for groups of disorders causing disturbances in thinking, feeling or relating.  Because inmates suffering from mental illness may not think, feel or relate in the way the average individual does, managing these inmates’ behavior may prove challenging.  During this block of instruction, participants will learn effective techniques for managing the behavior of inmates diagnosed with mental illness.


PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE

1.	Define behavior management.


PRESENTATION

All behavior has meaning.  Behavior management is a way to change a person’s behavior.  Even if you have never taken a course in psychology, you probably use behavior management techniques almost daily.  Are you a parent?  Employer?  Parents and employers use these techniques when praising or reprimanding children and employees.  Simply stated, behavior management helps to increase wanted behavior and decrease unwanted behaviors.

Behavior management focuses on a principle of psychology known as “Learning Theory.”  The study of learning processes is fundamental to understanding human behavior.  Our ability to learn from experience is greater than that of any other species.  Because we can learn from so many types of situations, between stimuli and responses, our behavior is less restricted by heredity.  

In contrast, much of what animal species do, when they do it, and how they go about it is controlled (or fixed) more by their genetic inheritance.  

We learn how to act as human beings; to live with others, to attend, to perceive, to reason, and to relate.  Our attitudes, tastes, loves, hates, fears, prejudices, and even neurotic symptoms are all learned.

Classical Conditioning
Classical conditioning is a type of learning initially studied by Ivan Pavlov.  Pavlov was a Russian physiologist who was involved in research of the digestive processes.  Pavlov began working with dogs to discover the role of saliva in the digestive process when he noticed that many of the dogs secreted saliva even before their food was given to them.  He determined that this response occurred whenever the dogs saw the food or heard the footsteps of the lab assistant that fed them.  What he noticed was an unconditioned stimulus (the food) eliciting an unconditioned response (salivation). 
	

Taking it one step further, Pavlov decided to ring a bell immediately preceding the presentation of food.  Originally, the sound of a bell elicited only orientation or the general response of attention.  At this point, the bell was considered a neutral stimulus and orientation an unconditioned response.  If the food is consistently presented immediately after ringing the bell, the sound of the bell alone will soon elicit salivation.  

In the context of classical conditioning, the organism (the dog) has learned a new correlation between two previously unrelated stimulus events (the ringing bell and seeing the food).  This is known as pairing, because once the association has been learned, the organism will respond to the signal as if it were the original stimulus.

Operant Conditioning
In classical conditioning, the conditioned response typically resembles the normal response to the unconditioned stimulus: salivation is a dog’s normal response to food.  But when you want to teach something new, you cannot use classical conditioning.  Like teaching a dog a new trick, you must first persuade the dog to do the trick and then reward the dog with either approval or food.  If you keep doing this, eventually the dog will learn the trick.

While the major feature of classical conditioning is a stimulus followed by a response, operant conditioning features a response followed by a stimulus event, known as a reinforcer.  Much of real life is like this, responses are learned because they operate on the effect of their environment.  This kind of learning occurs in our own species as well as in other animal species.  Alone in a crib, a baby may kick, twist, and coo spontaneously.  When left by itself in a room, a dog may pace back and forth, sniff, or perhaps pick up a bowl, drop it and play with it.  Neither organism is responding to the onset of a set of specific external stimuli.  Rather, they are operating on their environment.  

Once the organism performs a certain behavior, however, the likelihood that the action will be repeated depends on the nature of its consequences.  The baby will coo more often if each such occurrence is followed by parental attention and the dog will pick up the bowl more often if this action is followed by petting or reward of food.

A reinforcer is defined as any stimulus that follows a response and increases the probability of its occurrence.  So, in this form of learning, what happens after the response occurs changes the behavior and those responses that have favorable consequences are more likely to recur.  Operant conditioning will be used most to modify behaviors of inmate patients.

Four Major Operant Conditioning Procedures

Positive Reinforcement
Positive reinforcement refers to a procedure in which a reward follows the behavior and results in an increase in the response.  

This is what we use when we praise our children for their accomplishments.  Another example is a child who would beat their head against the wall when throwing a tantrum.  When this happens, the mother would take the child in her arms in order to restrain them and prevent them from hurting themselves.  Eventually the child learns that if he wants attention from his mother, he simply needs to beat his head against a wall.

This is particularly relevant when dealing with inmates.  Correctional officers do not want to get into the position of reinforcing negative behavior.  We reinforce negative behavior any time we meet an inmate’s demands when they are actively threatening to cut, or in some other way, attempt suicide or making suicidal gestures.

Negative Reinforcement
Negative reinforcement, which should not be confused with punishment, is a procedure in which a behavior is followed by the removal of an unpleasant stimulus (negative reinforcer) and so increases in frequency of desired responses.  For example, if a nonsmoker who is bothered by cigarette smoke (an unpleasant stimulus) asks a smoker to put out their cigarette and is successful, this would reinforce the nonsmoker and there would be an increase in the likelihood of similar requests in the future.

The concept of negative reinforcement is sometimes difficult to grasp.  Remember that a reinforcer increases the probability of occurrence so that positive and negative reinforcement has the effect of increasing the behavior.  A simple way of clarifying this concept is to think about math equations.  The word positive refers to adding something to the subject’s environment, whereas negative refers to subtracting something unpleasant from the subject’s environment.

Punishment
Punishment refers to methods that decrease behavior by following the response with an adverse consequence.  For example, if a child receives a spanking for saying a bad word, that behavior would likely decrease.  With inmates, if he or she receives a case and subsequent disciplinary action, there is likely to be a decrease in that behavior.

Time Out
Time out is a term frequently used by officers in psychiatric service positions.  Unfortunately, the term is not always used accurately.  Time out is a procedure for decreasing behavior in which the individual is removed from re-enforcers – like Restrictive Housing.  This procedure is used by parents who make their child sit in a corner when the child has been misbehaving.

Keys to Effective Behavior Management
The first two essential keys to effective behavior management are focusing on behavior and providing consequences.  Behavior refers to observable, measurable acts, not thoughts, feelings, or attitudes.

A consequence is something that follows a behavior.  Consequences can be good or bad.  

An important correctional management tool is to provide inmates with the consequences that their actions will have if they continue to display poor behavior.

Target behavior is the third essential key in effective behavior management.  This refers to behavior you have targeted to increase or decrease.  When selecting target behaviors, it is important to limit the number and be consistent in applying the re-enforcers.  For example, inmates who enjoy weightlifting during their recreation time may lose that privilege for inappropriate behavior.  Re-enforcers are most effective when they occur quickly, soon after a behavior is exhibited.  It is best for the reinforcement to occur immediately after the person exhibits the target behavior and before the person begins another activity.

Some target behaviors that might be selected for elimination in the correctional setting include:
•	Self-manipulative behaviors
•	Acting out behaviors
•	Yelling / being argumentative
•	Banging the bars of their cell
•	Flooding the cell
•	Throwing feces
•	Refusing to work
•	Fighting

Reinforcers
Immediately occurring reinforcers are not enough if they are not applied consistently.  This means that there must be consistency, in not only your actions but in the actions of correctional officers on every shift.  There also must be a positive working relationship between security and medical staff.  There cannot be social workers against correctional officers and correctional officers against nurses, etc.  

To be successful, target behaviors and reinforcers must be clearly defined and there must be excellent communication and consistency between all members of the treatment team.  This leads to consistency in consequence.  In other words, every single time behavior “X” is demonstrated, then consequence “Y” must follow.  It must be reinforced.  Not just by the psychologist, caseworker, or nurse, but also by the correctional staff.  The more control you have over an individual’s environment, the more likely it will be that you can change the behavior.  

The fourth essential key to effective behavior management is the selection of reinforcers.  Reinforcers should be consistent with the limit and lead approach.  In this approach, you must set limits on negative target behaviors and you must lead with positive target behaviors and reinforcers.

For example, if the negative target behavior was the inmate patient’s failure to attend school, placing them on ten (10) days commissary restriction would not be an effective reinforcer if they have only had $2.00 in their trust fund account over the last few years.

As another example, if you select showering as a positive target behavior (something you want to increase) you would not want to select as your positive reinforcer allowing the inmate patient to make a phone call.  Unless everyone involved in this inmate’s treatment has the authority to grant a phone call each time, they took a shower, this would not be an appropriate reinforcer.  In addition, all the other inmate patients in the program might decide to quit showering until they were given phone calls.  

An effective reinforcer is an appropriate consequence to the target behavior.  It is also important to identify reinforcers that the learner values.  Unless you identify the motivation for an individual, you will not be able to select reinforcers which will procedure the desire result.

Techniques for Increasing or Decreasing Behavior
Increasing behavior is building up the individual’s ability to act appropriately.  The techniques involve asking the individual to do something and once they have mastered that task, asking them to do a little more.  During each step in the process you provide positive reinforcement.  

Three (3) techniques for increasing behavior are:
•	Chaining
•	Shaping
•	Prompt and fade

Some positive behaviors are so complex that it is not wise to wait until the inmate patient exhibits it before you provide reinforcement.  Instead, break down the behavior into its component parts.  Then you can reinforce each part that is exhibited.  Essentially, each part of the behavior is viewed as a link in the chain.  Positive reinforcement is applied to each link.  

Chaining  
The word “chaining” has come to refer to this process.  For example, getting good grades in school is a complex goal.  Rather than reinforcing the whole act, component parts of the act are reinforced:  showing up at school, participating in class, doing homework, etc.

Shaping
Some behaviors are difficult to reinforce, especially if you wait for the person to do them perfectly.  In shaping, you should reinforce any attempt that the inmate makes to exhibit the desired behavior.  Each time expect more from the inmate and only reinforce if they exhibit the desired increase in behavior.  For example, controlling one’s temper.  

The first time, you may reinforce if the inmate walks away from a situation.  The next time, you may only reinforce if the inmate walks away without cursing, etc.

Prompt and Fade
Prompt and fade involve prompting to offer a cue for the person to exhibit a behavior.  The prompt can be verbal or non-verbal.  After the inmate begins to exhibit the desired behavior, begin fading the prompt.  This means using less of the prompt until you do not have to use one at all.  For example, if an inmate has a problem with complying with a rule, such as tucking in their shirt, you might initially give a verbal command each time you see the inmate with his or her shirt untucked.  Overtime, the inmate will learn what you expect, and may tuck in their shirt with just a look from you.  Eventually, the inmate should exhibit the desired behavior of tucking in his shirt without any prompting.  

Decreasing behaviors involves “unlearning” previously learned behaviors or stopping undesirable behaviors.  There are three (3) common techniques:
•	Ignoring
•	Withdrawing privileges
•	Time out

If an inmate patient’s behavior is negative and it does not have a chance of causing harm or disrupting the program, it should be ignored.  Ignoring is the withholding of a powerful reinforcer like attention and social contact.

If an inmate patient’s actions are serious enough to disrupt an activity, consequences should be given.  Taking away privileges that the inmate has access to can be a good way of reducing positive reinforcement in response to a negative act.  This technique is especially useful in the correctional setting.

If an inmate patient’s actions threaten others or represent a serious disruption of the program, then the inmate should be removed from the situation and placed in a stark environment with few reinforcers.  This process is referred to as a time out.

Severity and Course Specifiers
In order to properly manage the behaviors of an inmate with a mental health disorder, it is important for the correctional employees to understand some of the terminology being used by the other members of the mental health team.

Severity refers to the degree of mental illness affecting the inmate patient.  The severity is identified during the diagnostic process.  The specifiers of mild, moderate, and severe are only used when the full criteria for the disorders are currently met.  When deciding whether the presentation should be described as mild, moderate, or severe, mental health clinician will consider the number and intensity of the signs and symptoms of the disorder and any resulting impairment in occupational or social functioning.



•	Mild – few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present and symptoms result in no more than minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.
•	Moderate – symptoms or functional impairment between “mild” and “severe” are present
•	Severe – many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis or several symptoms that are particularly severe are present or the symptoms result in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning.

Course specifiers describe the current state of illness of the inmate patient.  They identify states other than the period when the inmate meets the full criteria for the disorder.
•	In Partial Remission – the full criteria for the disorder were previously met but currently only some of the symptoms or signs of the disorder remain.
•	In Full Remission – there are no longer any symptoms or signs of the disorder, but it is still clinically relevant to note the disorder.  After a period in full remission, the clinician may judge the individual to be recovered and therefore will no longer code the disorder as a current diagnosis.
•	Prior History – for diagnostic purposes, it may be used to note history of the criteria previously met for a disorder even when the individual is recovered.
•	Recurrence – it is not unusual for a person with a mental illness to go for a period of time in which the full criteria for the disorder is no longer met (i.e., in partial or full remission) and then develop symptoms that suggest a recurrence of their original disorder but they do not yet meet the full threshold for the disorder.
•	Principal Diagnosis / Reason for Visit – When more than one diagnosis for an individual is given in an inpatient or outpatient setting, the principal diagnosis is the condition established following the assessment of the patient as the reason for admission into a mental health program.  When more than one diagnosis is given, the “reason for visit” is the condition that is chiefly responsible for the current signs and symptoms the inmate patient is experiencing.
•	Differential Diagnosis – the distinction between two similar diseases/disorders by identifying critical symptoms that are present in one but not the other.
•	Provisional Diagnosis – the specifier “provisional” can be used when there is a strong presumption that the full criteria will ultimately be met for a disorder, but not enough information is available to make a firm diagnosis.  The clinician will indicate the diagnostic uncertainty by preferring to the diagnosis as provisional.
•	Not Otherwise Specified – because of the diversity of clinical presentations, it is impossible for the diagnostic criteria to cover every possible situation.  For this reason, each diagnostic class has at least one Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) category and some classes have several NOS categories.
•	Mental Disorder Due to a General Medical Condition – there is evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the mental disturbance is the direct physiological consequence of a general medical condition.

Malingering
As we all know, there are some inmates who are notorious for “faking” symptoms and manipulating the facts to get what they want.  There is a condition known as malingering that is present in some people diagnosed with mental illness that mimics faking symptoms.  While malingering is a true diagnosis, it makes obtaining a diagnosis in the correctional setting even more difficult.

Malingering is the purposeful production of falsely or grossly exaggerated complaints with the goal of receiving a reward.  Malingering can lead to abuse of the medical system with unnecessary tests being performed and time being wasted instead of allowing Mental Health professionals to focus on the legitimate problems of others.  

Malingering makes it very difficult for a clinician to make an accurate diagnosis.  The traditional clinician patient relationship assumes that patient is in genuine need of treatment, therefore many clinicians may feel uneasy about initiating a malingering assessment.  However, in the correctional setting, clinicians may be more easily inclined to label an inmate patient as a malingerer due to the manipulative behavior of many inmates.  Mental Health professionals are experienced with key points in malingering assessment.  As the main source of information for the mental health team, correctional officers assigned to designated Mental Health facilities also need to be familiar with the signs to watch for in an inmate that may be malingering.  

Screening for Malingering
Some guidelines to keep in mind related to malingering include:
•	Atypical presentation of signs in the presence of tangible incentives or environmental conditions;
•	Suspicious voluntary control over symptoms demonstrated by bizarre symptoms or unusual symptomatic response to treatment;
•	Fluctuation of symptoms that is consistent with external incentives, for example, an inmate that suddenly perks up when told he is going to be admitted to the infirmary for observation;
•	Complaints that are grossly in excess of the clinical findings of the disorder; and
•	Substantial noncompliance with assessment or treatment

 Clinical Clues to Malingered Psychosis
•	Inmate patient reports hallucinations and/or delusions but objective signs of psychosis are minimal or absent;
•	Auditory hallucinations are continuous instead of intermittent, vague or inaudible;
•	Inmate patient has no strategies to diminish auditory hallucinations;
•	Visual hallucinations are seen in black and white;
•	Hallucinations are not associated with a delusion;
•	Inmate patient claims a delusion suddenly developed or disappeared;
•	Contact of a delusion is bizarre but the inmate patient does not exhibit disorganized thinking; and
•	When discussing the offense that caused the inmate patient to be incarcerated, the presence of a rational, alternative motive for the criminal act, an extensive pattern of similar criminal behavior or a partner in crime suggest malingering.

Malingering takes great effort on the part of the inmate patient therefore; some malingers will tire the longer the evaluation lasts.

The Clarification Process
If a correctional officer witnesses’ behavior that may be consistent with malingering, they should report such behavior to the mental health professionals on their team.  The QMHP may decide to speak directly to the inmate patient regarding the evidence of malingering in their behaviors.  Remembering the “ABCs” is useful when seeking clarification:
•	Avoid accusations of lying
•	Beware of countertransference
•	Clarification not confrontation
•	Security measures

Security measures are included because some malingerers may respond by escalating their behavior to justify self-reports; in extreme cases, this may take the form of physical aggression or self-injury.

The information provided is simply meant to give correctional officers a better understanding of the criteria and processes that mental health professionals use to diagnose and manage the behaviors of mentally ill inmates.

SUMMARY 

As a correctional employee you are not expected to be a mental health professional; however because it is highly likely you will be in contact with inmates with various mental health issues – it is extremely important to be prepared to interact with these individuals in a professional manner.  Be prepared to recognize signs and symptoms of mental issues and be prepared to act and get proper help for these inmates.
